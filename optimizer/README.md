# Current State

If you understand python, you can access much of the same data set that you can through the Dom4 Mod Inspector.
This allows lookup functions etc, mappings, filterings, comparisons. (NOTE: Realized that our dear @larzm42 has an
ongoing dominions-tools fork (shoutout to @ )which probably is quite useful... and much better done than this data organization)
